# LMS for AI Courses - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for building an AI-focused Learning Management System (LMS) using SvelteKit, inspired by maven.com.

## 1. Core Features

### 1.1 User Management
- **Students:** Registration, login, profile management, course enrollment, progress tracking, access to live sessions and course materials.
- **Instructors:** Registration, login, profile management, course creation, course management (content, schedule, students), live session hosting, analytics.
- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication (e.g., email/password, OAuth).

### 1.2 Course Management
- **Course Creation:** Instructors can create new courses, define curriculum, add modules/lessons, set pricing.
- **Course Catalog:** Browseable list of AI courses with descriptions, instructors, pricing, and ratings.
- **Course Content:** Support for various content types: video lectures, text notes, code examples, assignments, quizzes.

### 1.3 Live Class Delivery
- **Scheduling:** Instructors can schedule live sessions for their courses.
- **Live Session Interface:** Integrated video conferencing (e.g., WebRTC-based solution or integration with Zoom/Google Meet API) for live lectures, Q&A, screen sharing.
- **Chat/Interaction:** Real-time chat for students to interact with instructors and peers during live sessions.
- **Recordings:** Option to record live sessions for later viewing by enrolled students.

### 1.4 Progress Tracking & Analytics
- **Student Progress:** Track completed lessons, assignments, and overall course progress.
- **Instructor Analytics:** View student engagement, performance, and course popularity.

### 1.5 Payment & Enrollment
- **Course Enrollment:** Students can enroll in courses.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Secure payment processing for course purchases (e.g., Stripe).
- **Order Management:** Track enrollments and payments.

## 2. AI Course Specifics

- **Interactive Coding Environments:** Integration with online IDEs or sandboxed environments for hands-on AI/ML coding exercises (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, custom sandboxes).
- **AI Tool Integration:** Potential integrations with popular AI/ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) or cloud AI services (AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform) for practical demonstrations.
- **Project-Based Learning:** Emphasis on capstone projects for AI courses.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Frontend & Backend Framework:** SvelteKit
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (or similar relational DB)
- **ORM:** Drizzle ORM
- **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets (for chat) / WebRTC (for live video) or third-party API integration.
- **Payment Processing:** Stripe API
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or similar utility-first CSS framework.
- **Deployment:** Vercel (for SvelteKit frontend/API), Render/Heroku/AWS RDS (for PostgreSQL).

## 4. High-Level Database Schema

- `users` table (id, name, email, password_hash, role (student/instructor), created_at, updated_at)
- `courses` table (id, instructor_id, title, description, price, created_at, updated_at)
- `modules` table (id, course_id, title, order)
- `lessons` table (id, module_id, title, content_type, content_url/text, duration, order)
- `live_sessions` table (id, course_id, instructor_id, title, scheduled_at, duration, meeting_link/room_id)
- `enrollments` table (id, student_id, course_id, enrolled_at, completed_at, progress)
- `payments` table (id, enrollment_id, amount, currency, status, transaction_id, paid_at)

## 5. UI/UX Considerations

- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Easy discovery of courses, clear course progress.
- **Clean Live Session Interface:** Minimal distractions, focus on content and interaction.
- **Instructor Dashboard:** Clear overview of courses, students, and earnings.

## 6. Deployment Strategy

- **Frontend/API:** Deploy SvelteKit application to Vercel for serverless functions and static asset hosting.
- **Database:** Host PostgreSQL on a managed service like Render, Heroku Postgres, or AWS RDS.
- **Media Storage:** Use a cloud storage solution (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary) for video lectures and other large assets.
